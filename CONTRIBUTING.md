# API Breakage and ABI Breakage
This repository uses the [semantic version system](http://semver.org/) for the API. The ABI, however, should always be considered volatile and should never be relied upon.

# Contributing Guidelines
Follow the coding conventions (they will be documented thoroughly here at a later date). If only minor changes are required they will be made for you during the merge commit. Large changes or new classes should be planned in a discussion issue first.
